# Welcome to the "Integrating physical devices with IOTA - The Track&Trace App." tutorial.

In this tutorial we are creating a simple web App. that simulates using the IOTA tangle as a global DLT to record events in a typical supply chain.

You will find the full tutorial with text and images [here](https://medium.com/@hugogregersen/integrating-physical-devices-with-iota-the-track-trace-app-351226b86c8b)

Warning!!
The Track&Trace App. is a server-side web App. built on top of the [Flask web framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), and should be run inside a Linux environment (the code will not run correctly inside a native Windows environment)

In case you do not have access to a Linux system, I suggest you install and run the App. inside a [Windows WSL environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

### Getting started

Python 3 and `pip` are required to install and run the App.

You also need to make sure you have the following Python libraries installed and working in your server environment.

- [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
- [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-WTF/)
- [Flask-Bootstrap](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Bootstrap/)
- [WTForms](https://pypi.org/project/WTForms/)
- [PyOTA](https://pypi.org/project/PyOTA/)
- [PyOTA-CCurl](https://pypi.org/project/PyOTA-CCurl/)

You can now install and run a functional version of the App. using the following procedure:

```
git clone https://github.com/huggre/trackntrace
cd trackntrace
python app.py
```
